- **Information choices for estimating opponent's cognitive ability** with Jeevant Rampal and Kirby Nielsen. <br><br>
  **Abstract**: _In the initial periods of simultaneous-move interactions, individuals' actions depend on their own cognitive abilities as well as on their beliefs about their opponent's cognitive abilities. In laboratory settings, characteristics such as an opponent's education and gender have been found to impact individuals' actions. In these studies, information about the opponent's characteristics is provided to the subjects. However, in real-world strategic settings, it is possible that individuals have to choose the information about their opponent's characteristics needed to estimate said opponent's cognitive abilities. We theoretically model the question of what information individuals acquire in such settings. We also model the question of hiding information about oneself from an opponent. We study the drivers of willingness-to-pay to acquire or hide information and test our hypotheses using an experiment._
